# Autonomous Decision Making AI-Scientist 

---

An autonomous multi-agent AI system that checks data trustworthiness before applying Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Generative AI.

---

🚩 Problem Statement

AI systems today make confident decisions without verifying whether the data itself is reliable.
Bad or incomplete data can still produce high accuracy, leading to unsafe and misleading outcomes.

ADAS solves this by making AI think before acting.

🎯 Project Objective

The objective of ADAS is to build an Autonomous AI Scientist that:

- Validates data quality before modeling

- Stops execution if data is unsafe

- Automatically performs data analysis, ML, DS validation, DL (if justified)

- Generates visual evidence and human-readable explanations

- Works across any domain tabular dataset

🧩 What This Project Does

ADAS follows a decision-first AI pipeline:

Accepts a dataset (CSV)

Checks data quality using defined thresholds

Stops automation if data is unreliable

If data is reliable:

Performs data analysis

Trains ML models

Validates results scientifically

Applies Deep Learning only when needed

Generates visualizations

Explains decisions using Generative AI

The system can say “STOP” — which most AI systems cannot.
